### EconTalk at the Hoover

#### Glen Weyl on Radical Markets

Henry George:

 - Noone can own the land as noone created it
 - 100% land tax (rental value) 0% else
 - Tax things that are unique
 - Problem is land/effort not so easily distinguishable

Any significant thing you own needs to be listed and can be purchased at listed price.

Owner/possessor

Stability already costs money in our society

Russ doesn't agree that in a standard real estate transaction the seller has a kind of monopoly power

Does the gap between what you'd be willing to accept to part from the asset and the price you attempt to sell it for constitute waste, monopoly?

Inspection -- pay fee, freeze price, inspect

Russ: this all ignores the cultural norms that have evolved. Homes are different.

Create a new system of migration, sponsor migrants for a share of their (?)

Tom: Is this all about Aligning Incentives?

Russ: why not just have migrants pay a fee?
Glen: sympathetic to the idea, but that has more of a centralised structure, an agency that would monitor, + people wouldn't get to know migrants, be exposed to the people they're getting the benefits from

Russ: these are big difficult changes
Glen: start with small, relatively non-controversial steps that would get a significant way toward goals, provide a test bed. But! we're desperately missing an alternative vision for addressing inequality and stagnation and political conflict. Without this vision we have reactionary nationalist populism and state socialism

#### #30: Zach Tellman

https://curiousprogrammer.net/2018/02/10/defn-podcast-episode-30-zach-tellman/

Proof and construction of data representation

Software should be self consistent, not 'correct'

The image of the city, Lynch

Central planning should be a seed

Clojures step forward is immutability free from static types

Clojure is best as glue, for less flexible pieces like Java, best as a hosted language that sits atop

STM is bad? Atoms are good enough

Has a decade's worth of writing things from scratch, not tools that can be reused

Narrow scope, purpose built tools

Brett Victor: here is a type of interaction we should be aspiring to, not concrete answers

Any map without utopia is not worth using, Oscar Wilde?

"there's a lot of stones you can throw at this"

Peter Theil: vampire

### The REPL

#### #2: Daniel Higginbotham on Specmonstah, Clojure Spec, and Ent walking trees

https://www.therepl.net/episodes/2/

Seq interface for merkle trees?

Specmonstah 'visiting' functions

Specs as an alternative to types for optimised bytecode

Using spec conform to dispatch on type of arg to a fn using descriptive names!
