# Some things I've watched

## TV Shows

- [Big Mouth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6524350/)
- [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6763664/)

## Web

- [David Nolen - Rethinking Identity with Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryPw28e0DNs)
  - I'm already convinced about the wins you get with Clojure but Vouch looks like Clojure + Blockchain and I'm curious to see what David Nolan and Mike Fikes are working on together!
  - "The performance of Java & Javascript virtual machines enable language design"
  - Curious to see how the people at Vouch think about identity (hopefully something like the 'intersectional social identity' Glen Weyl has been talking about)
  - "If you want to build a secure system you need to look at biology -- the way that we're built, you're guaranteed to get sick"
  - Demo: QR codes, biometrics via phone (secure enclave)
  - One set of specs for chaincode (!), server, app etc.
