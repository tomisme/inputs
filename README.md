This is an attempt to consume media more mindfully, publicly and (hopefully) productively.

I'm in the process of moving various notes and lists into this repo so it's a bit all over the place.

- [ðŸ“– things to read](reading/todo.md)
- [ðŸ“– things I've read](reading/done.md)
- [ðŸŽ§ things to listen to](listening/todo.md)
- [ðŸŽ§ things I've listened to](listening/done.md)
- [ðŸ“º things to watch](watching/todo.md)
- [ðŸ“º things I've watched](watching/done.md)

I try to keep copies of most things digital so feel free to [contact me](http://tomisme.com) if you want access to something I haven't linked.
