Discovered via LessWrong. Introduces the concept of "Spaghetti Towers": complex, difficult to refactor systems that are built out of repeated *spaghetti tests* (see what sticks). Similar to the [Lava Layer Anti-Pattern](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html). Colorful pictures.

I liked the [comment by MakoYass](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers#iTTrtXD2D3j5c5ZTi): "Suddenly very inspired with the idea of a programming language where even the most carelessly constructed spaghetti towers are fairly easy to refactor."
